# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 8

Today you will be adding a form to your existing salmon cookie project so that you can add new stores to the table by simply inputting their information with the form.

### Instructions

Here's some of the steps you'll need to take, but not necessarily in this order:

- Add the necessary HTML to create the input form.
- Don't forget <fieldset>!
- Use the constructor function as your guide to determine what input fields your form needs (hint: also consider what is passed in when creating instances!)
- Your JS will need an event listener and and event handler.
- As we saw in class, the event handler should use the take the data from the input field, pass it into the constructor function, and create a new instance of the cookie shop that then appends to the table.
- Are you going to do any error correction on input? You should.
- Build incrementally. Test frequently.
