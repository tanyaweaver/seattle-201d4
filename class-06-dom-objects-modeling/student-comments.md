# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Most helpful - excellent explanations by the instructor (Sam)! Sam is very thorough, engaging and passionate about what he is doing. I like the atmosphere in the classroom that he creates with his humor! I felt that codeacademy.com tutorials prepared me very well for the week 1.

- Good group of classmates. The TA's are great!

- There is a good number of teacher assistants, someone is always available or almost available to answer questions.

- the lecture / lab format is working great for me. - Sam is doing great job as instructor - knows the material and what's coming, etc. entertaining and entertains himself with 80s pop culture references. Good group of TAs and seems like a solid cohort in the class.

- The most helpful parts of class to me is when we get to see and practice code at the same time. Any time I type it myself, I retain it better.

- The parts of training most helpful to me is when we see examples of the code syntax and seeing it put to use. Sam does a great job at showing us how each piece of code has it's role and how it applies to what we're trying to do.

- Code review, peer programming.

- Having multiple TAs around during lab

- The instructional aspects of the class as well as lab. The one on ones really help, and the instructors/TA's are invaluable as a sounding board.

- Its mostly been review all week, the stuff on css has been helpful as well as when we just started using the document object in javaScript

- Starting with building something simple and continue to edit it with new information we learned.

- I've really liked the lab time we've gotten to learn how to write code.

- I have found our time working with partners in lab to be the most helpful. It's great to learn from and work with a partner. I also like that the instructors are there to provide immediate feedback.

- Lab time was excellent as it is super helpful to play around with the code to get used to it. Reading content seems necessary, but remains hypothetical until it can be put into use. Paired programming was unexpectedly very useful. It was great to have a second perspective on how to solve certain problems.

- I think the code reviews for me are the most helpful, being able to see the various ways everyone approached the problem. The lab time is also very helpful-- everything seems easy until I try to do it myself, so it's good to have that time to work through things.

- Enjoyed the pair programming. Learning more about scope and the importance it makes with variables.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Some of the lectures and demos seem really rushed. I'd almost like to suggest we start class at 8 am so we can do more with the lectures. Yet I'm so worn out by 4 pm that I don't know if I can take another hour. :)

- I felt like presentation on HTML the lists could have been much shorter. The concept is very easy and was well covered in the codeacademy tutorial.

- The first day is pretty long to sit in those not-so-comfortable-for-8-hour-chairs.

- A piece of that may be paying closer attention to when we are getting into the weeds with the random questions that we (me included) are asking => Maybe a system where those can get written down/pinned/slacked in a known location that can be reviewed/addressed at a later date/time.

- I left some comments in my most recent assignment about pair programming. I need some more guidelines on how to approach pair programming with someone who is not as far along in the lab and/or is unfamiliar with the basic concepts that were intended to be part of the lab.

- It would be nice to have this survey show up in instructure/canvas at least as an assignment. I kept looking for it there and refreshing the assignment list. Finally saw the reminder in email.

- I don't retain much from the readings and if I read it without going over it, I don't really understand it.

- Probably the basic syntax because we'd covered the material in the pre-work. Not trying to say it was pointless, but it was the only piece of information that I was already more acclimated with.

- Everything was pretty helpful.

- Sometimes we go down the rabbit hole a little too far and I feel it takes away from the instructional time relating to relevant material for the day's task.

- For me the week was a very slow progression, but I understand the need for it.

- We got distracted sometimes with other things beyond the scope of the class. I found it wonderfully informing, but I felt rushed in learning some of the information that we can use now.

- reading

- Probably the Code reviews, where we go over someone's code. It's not that the activity isn't helpful. I think that we could get as much out of it by spending half the amount of time on the activity.

- Having to comment on every reading assignment seems tedious. I have no qualms whatsoever about asking about concepts that I don't understand, and I think that's been very beneficial for me to get near-instant feedback from the TA's about those inquiries. I understand that it's a measure used to determine completion, but intro html/css are pretty easy concepts and I feel it's a waste of my TA's time to have to read 5 of my comments that sound similar to "No eureka moments, no questions at this time."

- I really can't think of any part of the training that was unhelpful. I guess I would say maybe the reading, but I know that's still a necessary thing.

- some of the review of the readings during class takes lots of time.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- Could we please get an actual break in the morning?

- Suggestion: more time should be allowed for loops - we barely touched on them. Less time for HTML lists. I found it very helpful to look at the Graph-Network diagrams in git - it helps sort out branching-merging-forking. I think it should be included in the lecture part. It will help to understand/visualize the git flow better.

- My shoes are covered in glue from walking on that floor. Other than that no.

- The only suggestion is that we try to stick to the material at hand a little bit more so we can cover a broader array of topics relating to the material at hand.

- It would be nice to have a finished classroom setting.

- If we suggested that people being their own mugs, we'll create less waste at the coffee bar! Class is going great. Everyone is very supportive and encouraging.

- No questions about the curriculum specifically. But I don't think I fully understand our building situation. Maybe it was communicated in the first couple days and I missed it because of the info overload, but I don't quite know why we're in a building that doesn't have a floor or ceiling, and isn't in a finished state that a normal human would expect in the downtown area of one of the most metropolitan cities in the country. Very odd.

- Suggestion would be to spend more time describing while loops and Arrays. With a visual example or reference to how the computer works through these with if else statements. Also, I think a visual aid for the process of git branching would be helpful. Even maybe dividing the class between the T.As, they are the driver and students the navigators, then switch.
