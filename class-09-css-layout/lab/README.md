# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 9

### New Technical Goal

-Incorporate some kind of CSS layout or a CSS framework into your page to improve the display

### sales-data.html

- This page contains your table (or tables, if you prefer).
- Its purpose is to provide sales information to the business owner, and as such, does not need much styling other than that needed to most effectively convey the information.
- It should link back to the index.html page in some way to make it easy for the business owner to navigate back to the home page.

### index.html

- This is the public-facing page for the business, and it needs to have more styling applied because your client (Pat, the owner of the salmon cookie shop chain) has brought you a bunch of ideas about what is wanted on that page (see the adjacent Assets directory for what must be included).
- This page **does not** link back to the sales-data.html page.
- Have fun with this page. Make it whimsical and useful.
- It is not necessary for this page to utilize JS, but you can if you'd like.
- You may use a layout scheme that utilizes Flexbox if you want, or a CSS framework such as Skeleton. Or just do all of your layout by hand. It's up to you how you choose to do layout.
- Think about the things that typically appear on the front page of a restaurant website: indicate the locations (you can make up fake addresses if you want), the hours open, a phone number (say, a fake one like 206-mmm-3001), and anything else you think should be there.
- Maybe, go look at some restaurant or confections websites to get some ideas. A big part of creativity is learning how to adapt the ideas of others.
- Reminder: Pat has asked that you use ALL of the images provided in the assets/ directory. Ha ha.
- Come up with a color scheme, and use a custom Google Font.
