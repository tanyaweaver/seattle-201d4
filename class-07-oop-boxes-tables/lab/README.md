# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 7

*(The basics of the assignment: you're going to render the output to the browser window in a table rather than in lists. And, you'll use your new skills in constructor functions to reorganize and reduce your code.)*

### User Stories (MVP)
- As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
- As a developer, I want to represent the data for multiple stores in a table format on the webpage, so my client can view the information concisely and clearly.
- As a user, I want my data compiled in place so that I can see my product needs as business at a glance.
- As a developer, I want to use object oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand.
- As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript.

### Technical Requirements
- Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
- Good use of a constructor function; style and syntax are correctly implemented.
- Duplicate code has been removed and DRY principles are evident.
- Main page meets requirements of the problem domain.
- Stores are correctly rendering as lists to the main page.

### User Stories (Stretch... only after completing everything above)
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new store to my webpage, so that I have the ability to work independently of my developer. This is a LARGE HUGE BIG stretch goal. There will be Forms and Events involved, which you are welcome to read ahead on and try to implement. We're not going to cover these in class until Thursday.
