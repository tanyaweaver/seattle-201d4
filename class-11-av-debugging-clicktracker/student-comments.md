# Student Comments from Week 2

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

I found it most helpful seeing the demos. When we see what each individual syntax does and it's behavior it makes it easier to understand.

Lab time was very helpful in the beginning of the week, not so helpful Wednesday/Thursday. Sam is an excellent teacher and he is easy to understand. I am excited to really drill down everything we've learned.

I think the thing that has helped me the most has been just spending lab time working on my code.

All code demos

Everyone doing better job of keeping on 'schedule' and tracking real-time when questions are taking us off-track (props to both Sam and Jonathon for catching this live and tabling the q's for later).

CSS demo was helpful to see in action. Doing the CSS Chocolate Pizza page was a great exercise in digging into css and flex box. I upped my game this week and managed to type in the demos while they were being presented.

It would be nice to see cohesion between book chapters, demos, exercises and labs. That helps me a ton - I'm paying direct attention, doing/watching locally. Frustrating though is getting shut down by simple transcription errors that make things not work like the demos and because can't see both html / css and js at same time, can't compare my work with demo to see where I'm missing something.

*Sam: We do strive to keep all of this in alignment as much as possible. With every cohort there are pieces that drift a little forward or backward in time based on how the class is 'getting it' and that can get us out of sync with the readings. Specifically, the question to ask here is how much 'starter code' would be the most effective with code demos? There's a fine balance to be struck between 'here it is, now just follow along' and the learning that takes place when just watching something unfold.*

Lab hours and the code demos were the most helpful this week. The material was more technical than last week especially with respect to JS and the demo examples helped solidify a lot of the questions I had during the reading. The flexbox demo was really really helpful! I feel like I have a great grasp on how to utilize it as a tool for organization.

Most helpful was the support during lab time.

Lab time and Sam's lectures!

The training on event handlers was very easy to absorb. Where objects and constructors were a big hurdle, our discussion/demo on event handlers was smooth.

Event Handlers, CSS

Code demos

The code demos earlier in the week.

The most helpful aspects were the demos about the lab and the lab itself.

I found the lab time to be the most helpful. I benefited from having one-on-one time with instructors and learning directly from my peers.

Building all the different objects

Since I missed a day, what I found most helpful was the YouTube videos and everyone willing to help me catch up.

Lab time was especially helpful this week, especially with the huge amount of JS covered.

it all seems like a blur, Once again I enjoyed the pair programming, It was helpful to work through problems together. Lectures have been great.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

Nothing this time. Most of it seemed very helpful.

None.

reading hasn't been helpful

Pair programming

I like the idea of reviewing the reading material, but I'm not convinced that looking at images of the pages of the book does much. If reading it ourselves is the 10% retention at the top of the pyramid, I would guess that this technique is < 10%. I wonder if taking a look at the page at the end of each chapter and using that as source for a summary of the key take-aways from the chapter, and then doing some live code demo for each of those points. If it were set up in the format of a pre-structured document (HTML) and CSS where some but not all of the content is there, and then we get those files and type-along with the instructor the missing pieces - we end up with a demo page of the key points of the chapter not just in reading and lecture, but in seeing and doing and ending up with examples/samples.

*Sam: This is a fantastic suggestion, and I very much appreciate the detailed response. We're always striving to fine-tune what we do, and comments like this make it clear where the gaps are between what we're aiming for and what we're actually achieving. I don't have time at this point to restructure Monday's class, but I'll implement this approach for our big pieces of content on Tuesday and Wednesday.*

Pair programming this week was the least helpful. If anything it would have been nice to have been able to work on my own code with a partner for this week rather than someone working on mine and me trying to navigate.

*Sam: The value of pair programming comes and goes from lab to lab in this course, and that is typical. Note that as you head into Code 301, there is a paired component to pretty much every lab in that course. A tricky part of this course is finding the balance of paired and solo work: more paired work better prepares you for 301, but there's a lot of solo work needed in this class to help fill in gaps and help each of you individually grow at your own pace. It's a dynamic thing. We make decisions each day about whether we think a pair lab or a solo lab would be more effective. It's not easy to find the perfect solution for everyone, but we try as hard as we can to take everyone's individual concerns into consideration.*

Least helpful was the lessons about css. I feel as though not enough time was spent on the concepts and too much playing in the sandbox.

*Sam: CSS is a lot like learning a foreign language. You start with some basic examples that give you a feel for the syntax, conjugation, and vocabulary (Comment tu t'appelles?) and you get lists of vocabulary words, over and over, and it gradually becomes more and more of a clusterf^@& as more piles on. There's good reason why foreign language classes in college curricula have huge credit hours attached. Ultimately, it's immersion and practice that makes you comfortable. Unfortunately, browsers are not as forgiving as native speakers who can decipher your intent from a malformed statement or question with an odd pronunciation or a piece of vocabulary that is a little off. Nonetheless, our approach is to go for accelerated immersion where your resourcefulness (plus applying 'discretion is the better part of valor') will get you moving forward as quickly as possible.*

I would've benefitted from a little more time to acclimate to objects on my own before jumping into paired programming. It was difficult to analyze what I had to do and communicate it to someone who was waiting on me--performance anxiety probably.

Everything was helpful

I felt lessons were rushed and kind of all over the place

I didn't like how the CSS was taught. It wasn't the instructor. Instead, it was how you decided to teach it which wasn't very focused. First, don't tell me about three or four tools and then throw me out there as was done on Thursday. Pick one and demo it completely. That tool should also be part of the prework. Secondly, Thursday should have been CSS about elements. Friday should have been about layout. That would have made Thursday easy and given people time to play with Flexbox Froggy to prepare for Friday. They would have also been focused enough to do that. Finally, I would have used the Chocolate Pizza page on Thursday and Friday: Thursday for elements, and Friday for layout. It would have been much more focused. I know things are not focused in the software world, but there's a fine line between playing real world games and just being unfocused.

*Sam: There's lots to unpack here. I'll do so verbally in class.*

I think the pair programming is the most helpful aspect of lab. However, I was paired with someone who finished everything before the actual lab time. This was not helpful for me because I barely did anything as the driver. I understand that everyone would like to be ahead, but these labs are specifically for working with a partner.

*Sam: Totally hear you on that. We generally preview the next day's assignments as the 'stretch goals' for a given day, and instead we should create 'off to the side' targets as stretch goals to alleviate this problem as applies to pair work.*

none.

Nothing really. It was just a lot of work and a lot to absorb. Much much more so than last week. A huge jump in work load and knowledge.

*Sam: It is indeed a huge jump from Week 1 to Week 2, and that's basically a narrowing of the funnel in what we're trying to accomplish each week with bringing the entire group into a cohesive cohort that is ready to advance to 301.*

Sometimes trying to follow along with Johnny ends up being more frustrating than anything. He goes very fast and this makes it difficult to listen and do what he's doing at the same time.

*Sam: Yeah, he goes fast sometimes, and that is at my direction because of the amount of material to cover in a given day.*

Reading, especially with the heavy JS chapters. They felt too abstract to really grasp the material, before we had had a chance to try it all ourselves.

*Sam: No doubt. They're almost inaccessible when you first read them, I know. That said, at least having looked at them and developed a little familiarity with the vocabulary and concepts helps in grokking the material the next day.*

At this point, I feel like I'm in the middle of the pond trying to stay a float.

*Sam: It's not just you. Hang in there.*

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

Only question I have is if I'm planning to move forward into Code 301 should this be something I discuss with Sam in the near future?

*Sam: We'll have one-on-one discussions during Project Week at the latest, but at this point you should make sure to have an application in very soon if you're planning to take the 301 that starts in two weeks.*

None at this time.

Nope, nothin yet

Not at this time

Why is the instructor comments field on this survey non-scrolling and only one line?

*Sam: Good question. I had no idea this was the case. I'll communicate this forward.*

I would like some thought put into being able to see at least the HTML and CSS on screen at the same time during demos - or two screens or jsfiddle for snippets and concepts.

*Sam: I think this again returns to the idea of demos that are based more on starter code. Given the needs of text size to be visible throughout a classroom, side-by-side code would be hard to accomplish as readable and also usable. The text size I use on my screen in class demos looks ridiculously huge on my own display. But its worth a try. Every class is different as to how well people in the back row can actually see.*

I would like to see more HTML/CSS/JS demo content that is tied to real-world best practices and design patterns - i.e. what is the HTML structure of common web site design patterns, and what is the CSS for common elements of web sites. The random examples are good for the basics, but aren't necessarily something that would ever be built.

*Sam: What we teach is appropriate to the technical skill of this course, and that will change quite a bit when you get to 301, where tools like jQuery and Handlebars and SASS enter into things. The other part of this is that real-world work can be very idiosyncratic in its use of practices, patterns, and tools. It's a wild frontier with a lot less standardization than you'd think, unless inside of a huge organization that drives its own standards.*

Give the support raises. They are doing awesome.

*Sam: Thanks for saying this!*

CSS is still unclear. It seems sometimes an attribute works, then when you try it again, it doesn't work in some other arbitrary setting. Can someone fix all of the broken about the CSS?

*Sam: People have, and we'll talk about this!*

No questions. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, but not unable to continue. I'd suggest that we go over skeleton or flexbox in more of a general manner. I found that we didn't really go into what a CSS framework was, but rather jumped right into how to use them. This had me using tools that I didn't really understand the nature of, which ended up with me having to redo a project because of misusing those tools.

*Sam: That's on me. I should have taken a few more minutes to explain what CSS frameworks actually are. I glossed over that part and I shouldn't have. We'll get it fixed.*

Slow down just a little. Some of us are new to the coding world.

*Sam: Week 3 is slower, and Project Week is mostly at your team's pace. For this course, Week 2 is the toughest.*

I think it would be helpful to for us to have a general idea of how long each project is supposed to take and, at what point does the individual need to stop an get additional help; i.e. lab 3 should take you about 5hrs if it takes you 13hrs you need to come find someone, my door is always open.

*Sam: That actual clock time is going to vary too widely from individual to individual to meaningfully set hard standards, but in general, the work should be completed within the 4-hour lab window, or perhaps with a little more like an hour or two tops. Any assignment that takes beyond 8 hours is a sign that a student has accumulated a significant amount of being behind. We strive for maximal accessibility, but that is hard to provide at midnight when a student is 8 hours into an assignment.*

I definitely accept the fact that the classroom we have is a temporary one, but there were a couple of times where the noise from the general assembly room was so loud that it took away from my experience. Construction and skateboards most notably. I'm not sure what could be done here except to hope that our temporary walls will be in place sooner rather than later.

Still have glue on my shoes.

Stop the skateboarding nonsense, and the ping pong noise is a little distracting during lecture times.

I know you all are doing your best with the space we have, but it's very distracting.

Please put more soap in the women's bathroom.

Are there specific dates when we will be moving or of different improvements?
