# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 10
### DUE: Fri 4/22 at 11:59p

## Chocolate Pizza!!! Create a webpage from a provided design comp

In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we've been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.

**GitHub Repository & Project Setup**

Create a new repository for today called **chocolate-pizza**. Be sure to do frequent commits, and do your work on branches. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching this project. Before writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work:
- When should you focus on styling?
- When should you make a decision about a layout scheme?
- When should you just build out the structure of the HTML?
- When you should you add JS?
- How much time to allow for the Peter Griffin CSS tweaking?

*PLAN YOUR WORK AND WORK YOUR PLAN*

**Assignment Overview**

The assets (Base design comp and images) can be found in the adjacent ***lab-assets*** directory in this repo. Download these files and move the assets into your repo. The file "PREVIEW" contains an image of what you are striving to build in HTML and CSS, so be sure to open it up and keep it handy... ***but note that it is not for actual use on the page.*** You'll also be provided a paper copy of this image... it is suggested you use it to mark up and sketch out page structure and identify where the image assets need to be placed.

All of the other image files are assets you will need to realize the design comp. It will be useful to make an inventory of them and where they will go on the page... but how you choose to manage and organize this inventory is up to your resourcefulness. It's best if you have a **plan** for how you'll manage this.

Suggestion: set up your work directory like this:

* index.html
* style.css
* app.js *(if you choose to use JS)*
* img/   *(a directory that contains all of your image assets)*

If you want to rename any of the image files, feel free to do so. The same goes for pretty much anything else you come up with as a way to do the work.

If you decide to use Skeleton (hint: Don't... it's more trouble than it is worth on this project. Do layout by hand for the practice. But if you really want to, go ahead.)... make a separate CSS directory to hold your CSS files.

**Requirements**

Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site. Reminders: Container elements (a box outside of your content box that might contain multiple content boxes) are very useful in managing layout. You will need to think about the relationship between parent and child / descendant elements as well as the order in which you place them in the HTML. Keep in mind that you can use *display: inline* in your CSS to force block elements, which would ordinarily stack, to sit side-by-side. And what about some flex action, maybe?

Use CSS to style the page to reflect the full comp image provided. Use what knowledge you have at this point (and any resources you are able to understand and use effectively from other sources) to style your site as closely to the design comp as you can: fonts, colors, layout, all of it. You have the resources and are aware of online tools which will help you find useful solutions! On a project like this, something that finishes the basic task is the goal... it can always be refactored with better design and code later. There are no right or wrong answers... just do your best.

OPTIONAL: Add some JavaScript functionality! Get creative, but make sure the style is complete before moving onto any additional features.

Submit: You'll be committing regularly and working on branches for additional Git practice. Submit the link to your most recent pull request into the Canvas assignment.
